COMMUNITY TAKE OVER REQUEST: UPDATING SOCIALS TO THE COMMUNITY
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Story of $ethinu project:

1)January: Main dev launched token, with LP burnt and CA renounced. 
Shortly after he left the project but did not hand everything of the socials to the other members. 

2) February: We decided to take over this Meme project with remaining dev member and community member. 
We liked the narrative so much. We have a great Ticker $ETHINU and we believe in the LONGTERM success of this project alongside of $ETHEREUM. 
So we created new socials and kept this token running since then. 

3)
-> As you can see the old twitter is not active anymore since january while we have VERIFIED twitter account and active daily!
-> we runnning old telegram and new telegram.
-> new website created for revamp. 
-> additional extra socials.
 
4) Dextools + Coingecko approved to update.

5) As long as ETHEREUM exists, we will coexist with ETHEREUM as its Original Meme Token

6) Since we dream of big things, let me end with this quote:
“The most entertaining outcome is the most likely.”
― Elon Musk
